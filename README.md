# HARINS
Artificial assistant for my indoor space.
### Ideas
- Morning routine lead ( weather, to-dos, mails etc. )
- Food order
- Light control
- Greetings
- Entertainment stuff ( series, movies, games, music etc. )
- Sending text from different platforms
- Setting alarm, creating to-dos etc.
- Article reading ( especially from sites like Medium.com which already has that functionality )
- Dialing, online meetings etc.
- Money transfer and bank related jobs

### Dreams
Can be done technically but not practical.
- Windows, gate and vantilation control
- Serching on the internet ( There are some AI models that capable of summarizing articles, could be used for this purpose )
- Using hand gestures for some of the functionalities to don't overdue voice usage ( it can be irritating )

All of these above functionalities are noted for implementing voice controlling.

### Fine Tunings
- Using focus for different screens and hiding initial processes under some animation etc.
- Couple of microphones are necessary to make it accessable all around the place.
